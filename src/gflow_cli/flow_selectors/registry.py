"""The Flow DOM elements gflow depends on, with the context that makes drift readable.

Scope: families with incident history, present on a FRESHLY LOADED editor.
State-gated entries (sidebar close) wait for `Reach` — see spec R4.

`editor` is the labs.google editor, which every account we hold now 308s away from;
`migrated_editor` is flow.google.com's, graded nightly by the canary's e2e (#1083).
